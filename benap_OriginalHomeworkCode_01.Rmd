# Challenge Code

```{r}
library(stringr)
```


## Challenge 1

```{r}
barnacle <- "Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed." #input string
barnacle_vector <- str_split(barnacle," ") #convert string barnacle to a vector of individual words
barnacle_vector[[1]][c(3,6,9,12,15,18,21)] #select every 3rd word from barnacle vector
```

## Challenge 2

```{r}
#create matrix m from the hw
m <- matrix(data = 1:80, nrow = 8, ncol = 10, byrow = FALSE)
m
```
```{r}
# extract the 2nd, 3rd, and 6th columns and assign them to the variable x
x <- m[ ,c(2,3,6)]
x
```
```{r}
# extract the 6th to 8th row and assign them to the variable x
x <- m[c(6:8), ]
x
```

```{r}
# extract the elements from row 2, column 2 to row 6, column 9 and assign them to the variable x
x <- m[c(2:6),c(2:9)]
x
```
